			Hello my first Upload 

			Web users do not usually prevent their browser from sending the Referer header. If they do, they can probably understand the error message and take some corrective action. How­ever, some experienced user may have configured the browser of a relative or a friend “to protect privacy” without explaining the implications, or a user might be used a public computer where such “paranoic” settings are in effect. Most web pages do not need the Referer header, so people don’t usually see problems—but when they click on a “Valid HTML” icon, confusion is created.
